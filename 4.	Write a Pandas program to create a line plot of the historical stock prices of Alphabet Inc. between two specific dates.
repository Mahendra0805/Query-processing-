To create a line plot of historical stock prices for Alphabet Inc. between two specific dates, you can use the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `yfinance` libraries. If you haven't installed `yfinance` yet, you can install it using `pip install yfinance`.

Here's a Pandas program that demonstrates how to create such a line plot:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the stock symbol and the date range
stock_symbol = "GOOGL"  # Alphabet Inc.'s stock symbol
start_date = "2023-01-01"
end_date = "2024-01-01"

# Download historical stock data using yfinance
stock_data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Plotting the historical stock prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(stock_data['Close'], label=f"{stock_symbol} Stock Prices")
plt.title(f"Historical Stock Prices of {stock_symbol} between {start_date} and {end_date}")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Stock Price (USD)")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This program uses the `yfinance` library to download historical stock prices for Alphabet Inc. between the specified dates and then uses `matplotlib` to create a line plot of the closing prices. Adjust the `stock_symbol`, `start_date`, and `end_date` variables based on your specific requirements.
